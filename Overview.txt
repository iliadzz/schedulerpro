Remaining Core Modules
These files handle fundamental application logic, utilities, and the main entry point.

js/main.js
This will be the application's new "conductor." It will import functions from all other modules and set up all the initial event listeners (e.g., button clicks, form submissions). The contents of the original init() function will be moved and adapted here.

js/utils.js
A module for generic, reusable helper functions that don't belong to a specific feature. This will include functions like generateId, formatDate, getContrastColor, and createItemActionButtons.

js/i18n.js
This file will be dedicated to internationalization (language support). It will contain the large translations object and the setLanguage() and getTranslatedString() functions.

js/features/history.js
This module will exclusively manage the undo/redo functionality. It will contain the HistoryManager object and its methods (doAction, undo, redo). The command classes (ModifyAssignmentCommand, etc.) defined in scheduler.js will also be moved here.

Remaining UI Modules
These files correspond to the remaining tabs and major UI components.

js/ui/shifts.js
This module will handle all logic for the "Shift Templates" tab, including rendering the template list, managing the add/edit form, and handling drag-and-drop reordering for the templates.

js/ui/events.js
This will contain all logic for the "Manage Events" modal, including rendering the list of existing events, handling the form for adding/editing recurring or specific-date events, and managing the color palette.

js/ui/settings.js
This module is for the "Settings" tab. It will manage saving restaurant hours, setting minimum coverage requirements, and handling the data backup and restore functionality.

js/ui/modals.js
A dedicated module for controlling the behavior of your various modals, especially the complex "Assign Shift / Time Off" modal. It will handle showing/hiding modals, switching between template/custom/time-off modes, and populating their fields.

Firebase Modules
This isolates all communication with the Firebase service.

js/firebase/auth.js
This file will manage user authentication. It will contain the logic for the login screen, handling sign-in, sign-up, and sign-out, as well as the onAuthStateChanged listener that shows or hides the main application.

js/firebase/firestore.js
This module will handle all data synchronization between the application's local state and the Firestore database, including the logic that overrides localStorage.setItem to write data to the cloud.

Excellent choice. Creating main.js is a pivotal step where we'll see the modular structure come to life. This file will act as the central "wiring" for the application.

There's one important detail: for this to work, we need to ensure the other modules (departments.js, roles.js, etc.) export the functions that our event listeners will call. I have written this main.js file with that in mind. You may need to go back to the files we already created and add an export keyword in front of a few more functions (like resetDepartmentForm or handleSaveEmployee).

Here is the content for js/main.js. Copy the code below and save it to that file.
